# 1. Basic Machine Learning concepts in astronomy

## 1.1 ML in astro resources

### Python resources:

* [**sklearn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [**astroML**](https://www.astroml.org/) - The [package](https://www.astroml.org/) with the [book](Material/Ivezic2020_00_table_of_contents.pdf)
* [A. Popkes' ML basics notebooks](https://github.com/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics)
* [M. Zingale's Computational Physics course](https://github.com/zingale/computational_astrophysics/blob/main/content/machine-learning/)
* [ML basics notebooks](https://github.com/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics/)
* [STScI's Hello Universe](https://archive.stsci.edu/hello-universe)
* ... (please feel free to share your favourite resources!)

### Textbooks:

* [astroML interactive book](https://www.astroml.org/astroML-notebooks/)  (use your uni library account to get the [textbook](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020sdmm.book.....I/abstract) PDF)
* [Mathematics for ML](https://mml-book.github.io/)  (for basic methods, free)

### Some good reviews for astronomy:

* [Baron 2019: Machine Learning in Astronomy: A Practical Overview](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190407248B/abstract)
* [Fluke & Jacobs 2020: Maturity of ML in astronomy research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020WDMKD..10.1349F/abstract)
* [Reis+2021: Unsupervised ML in astronomical surveys](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26C....3400437R/abstract)
* [Huppenkothen+2024: Best practices in ML for astronomy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv231012528H/abstract)
* [Dvorkin+2022: Machine Learning and Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08056) (has no figures but very crispy text)

### Lecture videos:

* [AI course by Patrick Winston at MIT 2010](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/video_galleries/lecture-videos/)
* Dozens of good focussed videos on youtube.. 

## 1.2 Basic terminology / approaches / methods

* [ML methods - how to classify them](https://github.com/zingale/computational_astrophysics/blob/main/content/machine-learning/machine-learning-libraries.md)

## 1.3 What we will cover in the next 2 days

Tuesday (Friedrich):

* [Classification](Material/Ivezic2020_09_classification.pdf) basics and methods
* [Regression](Material/Ivezic2020_08_regression.pdf) methods (tree-based and neural networks)
* Including uncertainties in regression models
* Interpreting ML models with [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)
* More advanced models (convolutional neural networks, e.g. for image classification or spectrum fitting)

Wednesday (Emily):

* Unsupervised ML basics
* Clustering methods
* Dimensionality reduction
* Symbolic regression
* A surprise?
