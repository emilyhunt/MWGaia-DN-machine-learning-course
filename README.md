# A two-day machine learning course

The following repository contains course materials for a two-day machine learning course at the [MWGaia-DN introductory school](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1413524/overview) in Coimbra, Portugal (9th - 13th September 2024).

## Topics
### Supervised  learning techniques
Classification and regression, with a focus on neural networks and tree-based algorithms. Work examples include source classification,  determining stellar parameters from spectra, and estimating photometric redshifts.

### Unsupervised learning techniques
Clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction methods (e.g. PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, self-organizing maps)

### Interpretable ML & the future
Interpreting machine learning models using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Symbolic regression for interpretability. Including uncertainties in ML models. The future of ML/AI, including the potential of transformers.
